# evolution-bootcamp-cucumber-home-task


## Create a set of scenarios for the following training examples:
1. https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/add_remove_elements/
2. https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/checkboxes
3. https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/key_presses
4. https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login
5. https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/hovers

## Homework requirements
### For Feature files:
- write scenarios that would cover functionality for the each of mentioned examples above
- scenarious should be written in the files with `.feature` extension which are located under `/features/`
- try to add scenarios outlines with `Examples` where possible
- tests need to have a proper Gherkin syntax with `Given-When-Then` structure
- add possibility to run different specs (feature files) by using appropriate tags

### For step implementation files:
- write step definition file(s) with `.js` extension under `/features/step-definitions/`
- implement the steps for all your features (write the code in `.js` files mentioned above)

## Homework will be considered as done:
- all 5 training examples are covered with features files
- steps used in the feature files are implemented
- your tests pass
- tests have a proper Gherkin syntax with `Given-When-Then` structure
- feature files and step implementation files are pushed to your repository
